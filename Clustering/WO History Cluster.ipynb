JUMPED 72-A, NO FAULTS, 72-A IS ZX-1 MAIN SLIDE. CHECKED SWITCHES AT INPUT/OUTPUT BOARD, THEY SEEM TO BE FINE. FAULT STRING ON PRINTS IS 72-180 STARTING WITH ZX1. LOOK AT ACTUAL WIRING OF DRIVES, IT'S 72B-180. NOT SURE WHAT CRWD AND CRF1 ARE, COULD NOT LOCATE THEM ON THE PRINTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE CONTROL RELAYS BUT FOR WHAT, NO CLUE, AND BECAUSE PRINTS DO NOT SHOW THEM I'M NOT SURE IF THEY ARE PART OF DRIVE STRING OR NOT, OR IF DRIVE STRING ACTUALLY STARTS AT 72B AND NOT 72?? NO DRIVE IN STOCK TO REPLACE ZX1 WITH, WHICH I BELIEVE THE FAULT CONTACT ON IT IS BAD. KEEP THINKING I WAS FORGETTING TO CHECK SOMETHING SO I WENT BACK OUT TO MACHINE. WITH WIRES OFF FAULT CONTACT ON ZX1 MACHINE RUNS. CHECK FAULT CONTACT WITH WIRES OFF READS GOOD? STARTED TRACING BACK FROM THERE TO CRF1. CHECKED TIGHTNESS OF WIRES AND 72B PULLED OFF WITH LITTLE EFFORT, THESE ARE SPRING TYPE CONNECTIONS. STRIPPED WIRE BACK AND PUT BACK ON RELAY BASE, TIGHT NOW. STARTED UP MACHINE AND IT RUNS. ALSO, CONFUSION ABOUT ZX1 IS CROSS SLIDE 1 NOT AUXILIARY DRILL/REAMER UNIT 1 (MAIN SLIDE). PRINTS ARE CONFUSING. MACHINE RUNNING. BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT TO CHECK OUT. 12/17/12 10141 I TALKED WITH ANIL AND WE THINK MAYBE THE 5V IS DROPPING. I MEASURED VOLTAGE NOW AND IT IS AT 5.0. WHEN THE MACHINE FAULTS AGAIN WE CAN CHECK IT AND SEE IF SOMETHING IS PULLING VOLTAGE DOWN. 12/18/12 8949 LOSING 5V IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER. CHECKED 5V, 12V, AND 24V EACH TIME IT FAULTED, ALL WERE GOOD. DID THIS SEVERAL TIMES. CHECKED COMPUTER 5V AND POWER SUPPLY 5V, BOTH GOOD. AIR CONDITIONER IS BLOWING WARM AIR. FILLED TRABON, IT WAS BELOW LOW LEVEL LINE. TIGHTENED QUITE A FEW TERMINALS ON SWITCHES IN OPERATOR PANELS. CHECKED 5V AT OPTO WHEN FAULTED 4.99 VDC, WHICH IS ALSO GOOD.\n",
