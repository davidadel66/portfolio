## Content
  - ## Regression
    - [Restaurant sales and Revenue Prediction](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Regression/Restaurant%20sales%20vs%20Revenue%20prediction%20_%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Created a linear regression from scratch to predict restaurant sales based on revenue.
    - [Stock Prediction](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Regression/Stock%20Price%20TimeSeries.ipynb): Stock prediction using scikit-learn comparison between different polynomial regressions.
  - ## Clustering
    - [Work Order cluster](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Clustering/WO%20History%20Cluster.ipynb): Historical data of Machine work orders clustered to recognize the most common issues and propose solutions based on notes.
    - [Song reccomendation](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Clustering/Song_Recommendation/Song%20clustering.ipynb): Using Spotify music data from kaggle. Song recommendation based on similarities between songs. 
  - ## Neural Networks
    - [Mnist Digit Recognition](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Neural%20Networks/Digit%20Recognition.ipynb): Used TensorFlow to practice digit recognition on the mnist dataset. Created a simple layer neural network.
    - [House Price prediction](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Neural%20Networks/NN%20House%20Prediction.ipynb): Use data from zillow for a specific neighborhood to identify house price based on number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and size.
    
    
  - ## Machine Learning from Scratch
    - [KNN](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Classification/KNN_No_ML_Library%20.ipynb): Created a K Nearest Neighbor algorithm from scratch to determine Wine Quality.
    - [2 Layer Neural Network](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Neural%20Networks/OneHiddenLayer_NeuralNetwork_No_ML_Library.ipynb): Created a simple neural network with sigmoid function as an activation. 
    
  
  
  
  - ## Other 
    - [Computer Vision](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/tree/main/Computer%20Vision): this folder contains everything computer vision related. Starting from the very basics.
      - [Classification using KNN](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_Classification___KNN.ipynb): Created a K Nearest Neighbor         Algorithm from scratch to identify classes of images.
      - [Cat vs Non-cat using a Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/davidadel66/portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_classification_Deep_Neural_Network_No_ML_library.ipynb): Created a Deep neural network from scratch and used it to classify whether an image is a cat or not a cat.
